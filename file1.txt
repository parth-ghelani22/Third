GitHub helps you save code, track changes, collaborate with others, and build software like a professional.

GitHub is a platform where people store, track, and collaborate on code.
Think of it as:

Google Drive for code
A time machine for your project
A collaboration hub for developers

It’s built on Git, which is a version control system that tracks changes in files.
